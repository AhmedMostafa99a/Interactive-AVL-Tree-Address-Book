# 📖 Interactive AVL Tree Address Book

---

## 📌 Introduction

The **Interactive AVL Tree Address Book** is a C++ console-based application that demonstrates the power of **self-balancing binary search trees** in a real-world context: **managing contacts efficiently**.

Unlike a simple list or unbalanced binary search tree, an **AVL tree** maintains strict balance after every insertion or deletion. This ensures that operations such as **searching, inserting, and deleting contacts** are always efficient, with a guaranteed time complexity of **O(log n)**.  

This project was built as part of an **Algorithms and Data Structures course** to combine theoretical knowledge with practical implementation.

## ✨ Key Features

### 📂 Contact Management
- Each contact is stored as a **key-value pair**:
  - **Key** → Unique integer ID  
  - **Value** → A structured record with:
    - Name (string)  
    - Phone (string)  
    - Email (string)

### ⚡ Fast Operations
Thanks to the AVL tree:
- ➕ Add Contact → O(log n)  
- 🔍 Search Contact → O(log n)  
- ❌ Delete Contact → O(log n)  
- 📋 List Contacts (sorted by ID) → O(n)  

### 🌳 AVL Tree-Specific Features
- Automatic **tree balancing** after every update.  
- Visual representation of the tree structure.  
- Supports **rotations**:
  - Left Rotation (LL)  
  - Right Rotation (RR)  
  - Left-Right Rotation (LR)  
  - Right-Left Rotation (RL)
